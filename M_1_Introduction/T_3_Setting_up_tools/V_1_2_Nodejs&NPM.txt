What is Node.js ?
    -> Node.js is javascript run time environment.

How to communicate between file in Node.js?
    -> To communicate between files we use export and import.
        -> eg. for export we use:
            -> const myName = "Prince";
                module.exports = {
                    // key: value
                    // myName: myName
                    
                    // if key and value has same name we can directly write key name.
                    myName
                }
    -> and for use in other file we use import.
           // no need to specify the extension in common js.
        -> eg. const importedSecondModule = require("./second");
            // it gives you the object.
            
            console.log(importedSecondModule);
            // like: { myName: 'Prince' }
            
            // if you want to access the values use like this.
            console.log(importedSecondModule.myName);
            
            // it will print "Prince".

->  we can also use "EcmaScript Modules".

    -> To use EcmaScript for export and import we have create files with ".mjs" extension.

        -> To export we use:
            eg. const myName = "Prince"; 
                export { myName };

        -> To import: use the same variable name as you give in second.mjs file.
            eg. import { myName } from "./second.mjs";
                console.log(myName);

What is NPM ? 
    -> It is node package manager for Node.js. Its comes with Node.js.
    
    -> To Initilize npm into your project we use:
        -> goto terminal and enter "npm init".

    -> To check the globle packages you install we use:
        -> npm list -g --depth=0
    
    -> if we delete the node_modules folder and reinstall the all deleted modules we use:
        -> "npm install" it install all the dependances which is present inside package.json file.
