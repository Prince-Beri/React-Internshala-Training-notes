Server: 
-> A web server is a dedicated computer responsible for running websites sitting
out on those computers somewhere on the Internet. They are specialized programs 
that circulate web pages as summoned by the user. The primary objective of any web 
server is to collect, process and provide web pages to the users.


JSON: 
    -> JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.      
    -> JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data.
    -> JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.
    -> JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand.
    eg. {
            "employees":[
                {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
                {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
                {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
            ]
        }

GraphQL: 
    -> GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those 
    queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable 
    description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly 
    what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and 
    enables powerful developer tools.
