There are 3 types for rendering.
    -> SSR : Server side rendering(SEO friendlly).
    -> CSR : Client side rendering also called SPA(Single page applications)(Not so SEO friendlly).
    -> Hybrid.

SEO : Search Engine Optmization(SEO) is the process of improving the quality of website 
traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic 
(Known as "natural" or "orgainc" results) rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

There are 2 examples of SSR websites Steam (dynamic pages) and netlify(static pages).

How we can identify the web page is SSR or not ?
    -> If a server returns different markup for every pages and there have different meta 
    tags for each page, the server uses either:
    (a) server side rendering.
    (b) static pages.

Static pages: 
    -> Markup is already created for all pages before it is placed on the server. it is Not 
    dynamically assembled on every request. The server sends the same html markup all the time.

Server side rendering: 
    -> Markup is dynamically generated on every request. The server takes data from database
    ,injects the data into html template, then sends back the final markup.
